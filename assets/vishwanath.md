Introduction
The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, also known as the Golden Temple, is one of the most revered temples in India, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located in the holy city of Varanasi (also known as Kashi), in the state of Uttar Pradesh, it holds immense religious significance for Hindus. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, which are considered the holiest of Shiva temples.

Varanasi, often referred to as the "Spiritual Capital of India," is one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, with its name rooted in the belief that it was founded by Lord Shiva. Devotees believe that the temple offers a unique pathway to attain moksha (liberation) and that a visit to Kashi is incomplete without a darshan (holy sight) of Lord Vishwanath.

History
The Kashi Vishwanath Temple has a rich and storied history:

The temple's original structure is believed to have been constructed by Raja Harishchandra in 490 AD. Over centuries, the temple was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times due to invasions, primarily by Islamic rulers.

Rani Ahilyabai Holkar, the queen of Indore, reconstructed the present temple structure in 1780 after it was destroyed by Aurangzeb in 1669. She ensured that the spiritual essence of the place remained intact.

The temple’s dome was later gilded in gold by the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1835, which led to the temple being referred to as the "Golden Temple of Varanasi."

Architectural Features
The Kashi Vishwanath Temple stands as a beautiful example of ancient Indian architecture with its spires, domes, and intricate carvings. The temple complex is spread over a large area and houses several smaller shrines, each dedicated to different deities.

Main Features:
Jyotirlinga: The central deity of the temple is Lord Shiva, represented as a Jyotirlinga (a phallic symbol symbolizing divine light). Devotees believe that a glimpse of this Jyotirlinga cleanses one of all sins.

Golden Domes: The temple is adorned with two stunning golden domes, made possible through donations from Maharaja Ranjit Singh. These domes symbolize the grandeur and historical importance of the site.

Gyanvapi Well: This sacred well is located within the temple complex. According to legend, the original Shivalinga was hidden in the well to protect it during Aurangzeb’s invasion.
